This project was performed for a class during my MS program in Data Analytics Engineering. The assignment was to optimize the schedule for the NFL based on the constraints described in "NFL Schedule Assignment.pptx" and subject to the information provided in the input csv's. The project involves building an input database, using that data to build  a Gurobi model, optimizing the model, and printing the results back to the database.
